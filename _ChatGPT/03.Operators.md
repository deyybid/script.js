## Day 03: Lesson on JavaScript Integration with HTML
### 1. Arithmetic Operators
**Analogy**
- Think of arithmetic operators as the tools you use in a kitchen. Just like you use different tools to mix, chop, or bake, these operators help you perform different mathematical operations.

**Operators**
- `+` (**Addition**): Adds two values.
- `-` (**Subtraction**): Subtracts the second value from the first.
- `*` (**Multiplication**): Multiplies two values.
- `/` (**Division**): Divides the first value by the second.
- `%` (**Modulus**): Finds the remainder of the division of the first value by the second.

**Sample Code**
```JavaScript
let a = 10;
let b = 5;

console.log(a + b); // 15
console.log(a - b); // 5
console.log(a * b); // 50
console.log(a / b); // 2
console.log(a % b); // 0
```

**Tips and Tricks**
- Use parentheses to control the order of operations: (a + b) * c.
- Be careful with division by zero as it will result in Infinity or -Infinity.

**Best Practices**
- Always use clear and descriptive variable names to make your code more readable.
- Ensure you handle division by zero cases where necessary.

**Final Exercise**
- Write a function that takes two numbers and performs all the arithmetic operations on them, returning the results as an object.

### 2. Assignment Operators
**Analogy**
- Imagine assignment operators as shorthand ways to write down results after performing operations, like updating your grocery list with quantities.

**Operators**

- `=` (**Assignment**): Assigns a value to a variable.
- `+=` (**Addition Assignment**): Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
- `-=` (**Subtraction Assignment**): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

**Sample Code**
```JavaScript
let x = 10;
x += 5; // equivalent to x = x + 5
console.log(x); // 15

let y = 20;
y -= 10; // equivalent to y = y - 10
console.log(y); // 10
```

**Tips and Tricks**
- Use shorthand operators to write cleaner code and reduce redundancy.

**Best Practices**
- Use shorthand operators when appropriate to keep your code concise.
- Avoid using `=` in expressions that require comparison; use comparison operators instead.

### 3. Comparison Operators
Analogy: Comparison operators are like decision-makers that help you figure out if things are equal, not equal, or if one thing is greater or lesser than another.

**Operators**
- `==` (**Equal to**): Checks if two values are equal (type coercion allowed).
- `===` (**Strict Equal to**): Checks if two values are equal and of the same type (no type coercion).
- `!=` (**Not Equal to**): Checks if two values are not equal (type coercion allowed).
- `<` (**Less than**): Checks if the left value is less than the right value.
- `>` (**Greater than**): Checks if the left value is greater than the right value.

**Sample Code**
```javascript
console.log(5 == '5');  // true (type coercion)
console.log(5 === '5'); // false (different types)
console.log(5 != '5');  // false (type coercion)
console.log(5 < 10);    // true
console.log(15 > 10);   // true
```

**Tips and Tricks**
- Use `===` for strict equality to avoid unexpected type coercion issues.
Always compare values in a way that makes the intent of your code clear.

**Best Practices**
- Prefer `===` and `!==` over `==` and `!=` to avoid type coercion issues.

**Final Exercise**
- Write a function that compares two numbers and returns a string indicating whether they are equal, not equal, or which one is greater.

### 4. Logical Operators
**Analogy**
- Logical operators are like the decision-making criteria you use when making complex choices, such as deciding whether you should go out based on multiple conditions.

**Operators**

- `&&` (**Logical AND**): Returns true if both operands are true.
- `||` (**Logical OR**): Returns true if at least one of the operands is true.
- `!` (**Logical NOT**): Returns true if the operand is false.

**Sample Code**
```JavaScript
Copy code
let a = true;
let b = false;

console.log(a && b); // false (both must be true)
console.log(a || b); // true (at least one is true)
console.log(!a);     // false (opposite of a)
```
**Tips and Tricks**
- Use logical operators to combine multiple conditions in control flow statements.
Remember that `&&` has higher precedence than `||`.

**Best Practices**- Use logical operators to create clear and meaningful conditions in if statements and loops.

**Final Exercise**
- Create a function that checks if a user is eligible for a special offer based on multiple conditions (e.g., age and membership status) using logical operators.
