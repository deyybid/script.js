## Day 02: Lesson on JavaScript Integration with HTML
### 1. Variables
**Analogy**
- Think of variables as labeled storage boxes. Each box can hold a different type of item (data). The label (variable name) helps you identify and use the item inside the box. In JavaScript, you can use different types of labels (keywords) to define how these boxes behave.

1. `var`
   - The old way of creating boxes. These boxes are global or function-scoped and can be re-labeled (reassigned) and even redeclared within their scope.
2. `let`
   - A modern way to create boxes that are block-scoped. They can be reassigned but not redeclared in the same block.
3. `const`
   - A special kind of box that cannot be reassigned or redeclared once it’s labeled. The contents of the box can still change if it’s an object or array.

**Sample Code**
```JavaScript
// Using var
var oldBox = "I'm a box with var";
oldBox = "I can be reassigned";

// Using let
let modernBox = "I'm a box with let";
modernBox = "I can also be reassigned";

// Using const
const immutableBox = "I'm a box with const";
// immutableBox = "I can't be reassigned"; // This will cause an error

// Block scope example
if (true) {
    var globalVar = "I am globally scoped";
    let blockLet = "I am block scoped";
    const blockConst = "I am also block scoped";
}
console.log(globalVar); // Works
console.log(blockLet); // Error: blockLet is not defined
console.log(blockConst); // Error: blockConst is not defined
```

**Tips and Tricks**

- Prefer `let` and `const` over `var` to avoid issues with variable scoping.
- Use `const` by default, and only use `let` when you need to reassign a variable.
- Choose descriptive names for your variables to make your code more readable.


**Best Practices**
- Use `const` by default unless you know the variable’s value will change.
- Avoid global variables to prevent conflicts and bugs.
- Use meaningful names for variables to convey their purpose.

**Final Exercise**
- Create a small script where you declare variables using `var`, `let`, and `const`. Then, try to reassign and redeclare them as well as experiment with block scope.
Document the results and explain any errors you encounter.

### 2. Data Types
**Analogy**
- Think of data types as different kinds of containers. Each container holds a specific type of data, and you need to choose the right container for the data you have.

**Data Types**
- **String**: A container for text. It’s like a string of characters that can be letters, numbers, or symbols.
- **Number**: A container for numerical values, both integers and floating-point numbers.
- **Boolean**: A container that holds only two possible values: `true` or `false`. It’s like a switch that can be either on or off.
- **Undefined**: A container that has no value assigned. It’s like a box with no label.
- **Null**: A container explicitly set to have no value. It’s like a box you intentionally emptied.
- **Object**: A container for a collection of values in the form of key-value pairs. Think of it as a structured collection of related items.
- **Array**: A special type of object used to store ordered lists of values. It’s like a list of items where each item has a specific position.

**Sample Code**
```JavaScript
// String
let name = "John Doe";

// Number
let age = 30;
let height = 5.9;

// Boolean
let isStudent = true;

// Undefined
let notAssigned;

// Null
let emptyBox = null;

// Object
let person = {
    name: "John Doe",
    age: 30,
    height: 5.9
};

// Array
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];

console.log(name); // "John Doe"
console.log(age); // 30
console.log(isStudent); // true
console.log(notAssigned); // undefined
console.log(emptyBox); // null
console.log(person.name); // "John Doe"
console.log(colors[1]); // "green"
```

**Tips and Tricks**
- Always initialize variables with a value to avoid unexpected undefined values.
- Use `typeof` to check the type of a variable (`console.log(typeof age); // "number"`).
- For complex data structures, prefer using objects or arrays as they provide more flexibility.

**Best Practices**
- **Validate data types** before using variables, especially when dealing with user input or external data.
- **Use `null` intentionally** to represent the absence of value.
- **Structure objects and arrays** logically to keep your code organized.

**Final Exercise**
- Write a script that declares variables of different data types. Create an object and an array, populate them with relevant data, and then log each variable and its type to the console. Additionally, create a function that accepts various data types and prints them out along with their type.
